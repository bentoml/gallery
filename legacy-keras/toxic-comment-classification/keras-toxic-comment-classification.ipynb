    "# BentoML Example: Keras Toxic Comment Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "BentoML is an open-source framework for machine learning **model serving**, aiming to **bridge the gap between Data Science and DevOps.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Scientists can easily package their models trained with any ML framework using BentoMl and reproduce the model for serving in production. BentoML helps with managing packaged models in the BentoML format, and allows DevOps to deploy them as online API serving endpoints or offline batch inference jobs, on any cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before reading this example project, be sure to check out the [Getting started guide](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML/blob/master/guides/quick-start/bentoml-quick-start-guide.ipynb) to learn about the basic concepts in BentoML.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use BentoML to turn a Keras model into a docker image containing a REST API server serving this model, how to use your ML service built with BentoML as a CLI tool, and how to distribute it a pypi package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is built based on: https://www.kaggle.com/sarvajna/keras-sequential-model-lb-0-052\n",
